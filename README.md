# Made for educational purpuses.
# It's a ploting app and it only plot simple functions like y=x^2
# To use it you just call the function and select the color of choice or select random color and select the power of x ex(y=x^0.3).
# Like this powercalc(0.3, red)
# And then show the plot by calling an other function 
# plt.show()
# Then if u run the program it will plot it
