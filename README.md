# Made for educational purpuses.
This program was made when i started learning python and it has no real use.
To use it you just call the powercalc() function and select the color of choice or select random color and select the power of x ex(y=x^0.3).
Like this powercalc(0.3, red)
And then show the plot by calling an other function 
plt.show()
Then if u run the program it will plot it
